## Installation

```
npm i

## Usage

### User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

### Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category, in this case, Age in a descending order.

- Filter the users by at least one property, in this case, Name.
